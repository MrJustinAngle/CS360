The requirements of this app was to allow the user to create an account and be able to track their weight along with a goal weight. They were to be able to add their daily weight and input their goal weight and the app would show them their progress along with a notification (if they agreed to be notified) when they reach their inputted goal weeight. This app was designed to be a health app alowing the user to track their weight progress.

The screens and features needed was a login screen, a screen to view the data, and a screen to enter new data. This allowed the app to be simplistic while also meeting user requirements. I ensured my design was easy to comprehend and easy to navigate. I believe my designs were successful because they incorporated the requirements while also making it easy to navigate

I approached coding my app by starting with a simple outline and working from there. The strategies I used were improved upon as I continued coding, sometimes I had to go back to the drawing board to ensure I was doing it correctly. I can apply the strategies to almost anything that I work on, allowing myself time to plan before executing is important.

I tested the code using an API 35 phone through Android Studio, ensuring everything worked the way I wanted. I ensured I was able to add new data and view that data in the recycler view. This process is important as you are able to catch any error that may populate in the app and fix it before releasing the app to the public.

Everything used in this course was new to me, I never used Android Studio or even an Android device, in fact I'm a full Apple person. So understanding the ins and outs of the program was difficult. My first plan for my app did not work out as I found out it was a bit too difficult so I had to simplify it making it a bit easier to code.

I think I did a really good job at the authentication component of the app. This was my first time working with SQLite and a login screen. So getting the database to authenticate the user and allow the user to register the account was impressive.
